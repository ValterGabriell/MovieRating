  <p>Run the app.</br>
  
<h1>Endpoint's Flow</h1>
<p>After doing all that, let's go to the endpoints.</br>

Then, we need do login our admin to get the token and pass to other endpoints to use them.
  
  
  
  After that, we can create download our movies from external API using:
  
  
  ```bash
@POST
api/login
``` 
with the request body

```bash
{
	"username":"admin",
	"password":"admin"
}
``` 
  This endpoint is usefull to login our simple user too. After you do this, take the user token, pass in the authentication on insomnia using Bearer, then you can download all movies from external API.
  
```bash
@GET
admin/getMovies
``` 
And all movies will be downloaded.

so, let's create our simple user to rate the movies. Use this endpoints:

```bash
@POST
user/save
``` 

with the request body

```bash
{
	"fullname":"simple-user",
	"username":"simple",
	"email":"email@gmail.com",
	"password":"123"
}
``` 

Wait for this answer.

Doing that, you can start to rate the movies. First, login the simple user using the previus endpoint to login. Then, follow the next endpoint to rate 
a movie:

```bash
@POST
movie/rateMovie/{movie-id}
``` 

passing in the request body the note from rate

```bash
{
	"rate":6
}
``` 

When a lot of people rate the same movie, all the scores will be added up and averaged. You can check the averaged following this next endpoint:


```bash
@POST
movie/average/{movie-id}
``` 
 
 remeber to pass the simple user token on header of requisition.
 
 You can also update a rate of movie using this endpoint:
 
 
  
```bash
@PATCH
movie/update/{movie-id}/rate
``` 
 
  ```bash
{
	"rate":85
}
```
